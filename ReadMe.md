# SkillSwap

SkillSwap Hub is a peer-to-peer micro-learning platform that allows users to teach, learn, and exchange practical skills in short, focused sessions. A key enhancement in this phase is integrating live video sessions using Google Meet, allowing learners and teachers to book, join, and participate in real-time meetings directly from the application.

This project is a full-stack web application built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React on the frontend and FastAPI on the backend. It demonstrates authentication, protected routes, database models, RESTful endpoints, state management, and third-party API integration.
